# Remake your MadLib from Snap! in Python

Step 1: Use the same story or write/find a new short story or informative piece. It should be 3 to 5 sentences.

Step 2: Make at least eight blanks by removing some nouns, adjectives, and verbs. 

Step 3: Create a list with at least five items for each type of word you removed.

Step 4: Each blank should be filled with a randomly selected word of the correct type. For example, if you removed an adjective from the story, the blank should be filled with a random word from your adjective list.  

Step 5: Use print statements to output your MadLib.
